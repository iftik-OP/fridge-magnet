## Firebase Configuration

This project uses Firebase. To set up Firebase in your development environment:

1. Copy `lib/firebase_options.template.dart` to `lib/firebase_options.dart`
2. Replace the placeholder values in `firebase_options.dart` with your Firebase project configuration
3. You can find these values in your Firebase Console:
   - Go to Project Settings
   - Under "Your apps", select your app
   - Copy the configuration values

Note: Never commit `firebase_options.dart` to version control as it contains sensitive information.
